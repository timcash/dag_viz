# 3D DAG Visualization

A high-performance, immersive 3D visualization for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), built with **Three.js** and **Bun**. This project features spline-based camera navigation, context-aware nested layouts, and weighted edge rendering to explore complex hierarchical data.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎥 Spline-Based Fly-Through Navigation
Experience a seamless "traveling" sensation as you navigate through the graph. Clicking a node triggers a cinematic camera flight path that swoops *through* the selected node to reveal the sublayer below, providing a strong sense of depth and hierarchy.

### 💡 Weighted Edge Glow
Edges are rendered with variable opacity and color intensity based on their "weight" (simulated randomness for demo).
- **High Weight**: Bright white/cyan, fully opaque.
- **Low Weight**: Dim blue, semi-transparent.
This visual hierarchy makes important connections instantly pop.

### 🧩 Context-Aware Nested Layouts
Sublayers are dynamically generated and positioned directly **below** their parent node in 3D space. This maintains spatial context—when you drill down, you are literally looking "under the hood" of the specific node you selected.

### 🧪 Robust Smoke Testing
Includes a comprehensive automated smoke test suite (`smoke_test.ts`) powered by **Puppeteer**.
- Verified rendering of 12+ nodes and curved edges.
- Automated verification of camera transitions and log outputs.
- Generates a visual report `SMOKE.md` with screenshots of every state.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Bun](https://bun.sh) (v1.0+)

### Installation
```bash
bun install
```

### Development
Start the local development server:
```bash
bun run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the graph.

### Running Smoke Tests
Run the automated verification suite:
```bash
bun run smoke
```
This will:
1. Start a fresh server instance on a random port.
2. Launch a headless browser to interact with the app.
3. Capture screenshots and verify logs.
4. Generate `SMOKE.md` with the results.

## 🎮 Controls
- **Left Click**: Select a node and "fly through" to its sublayer.
- **Scroll Wheel**: Zoom in/out. Auto-navigates up when zooming out far enough.
- **Double Click**: Create a new node at the cursor position (Demo).
- **WASD**: Pan the camera.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Graphics**: Three.js
- **Testing**: Puppeteer
- **Linting**: ESLint
